IpPrint4
========

my second android step

ipprint4 is a small demo tool to print to Intermec portable WLAN printers. It comes with some demo files in different printer languages, like ESC/P, FingerPrint and IPL.

First you have to either type or discover the right IP enabled printer device.

After you have defined the IP printer (using the IP address), you can connect to the printer.

When the printer is connected you can browse the provided demo print files and for example select an ESC/P, 2 inch receipt print demo.

Finally you print the demo file on the IP enabled label/receipt printer.
